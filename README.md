I developed a hybrid model for mastitis classification, leveraging XGBoost, LightGBM, and GRU networks, implemented using Python, Keras/TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The model enhances classification accuracy by utilizing features such as age, parity, pH, conductivity, CMT, lactation stage, and GBA. XGBoost and LightGBM efficiently modeled feature interactions, while GRU captured sequential patterns, with predictions combined through weighted averaging. The hybrid approach outperformed standalone models, as evaluated by accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, providing a robust diagnostic tool for veterinarians and dairy farmers.
